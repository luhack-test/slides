# What is ethical hacking?

Taking advantage of something’s existing functionality in an unintended way to achieve a goal\.

In ethical hacking, this goal is to  **improve the security of a system**. This is achieved through finding and  __responsibly disclosing__  vulnerabilities in a process called  __Penetration Testing__.

Most importantly\, this process is done  __legally__  and with  __explicit permission__  from the system owner.

# Avoid these laws with some simple steps

Don’t mess with systems that aren’t yours\, instead practice on either your own hardware\, our lab machines\, and websites such as Hack The Box\.

When doing pen\-tests\, **always** discuss with the client to decide on appropriate scope and get this **in writing**.
