# Metasploit

---

# What is Metasploit?

- Offensive security automation tool
- fully open source
- tries to guarantee reliability and trustworthiness of exploits
- roughly the same age as Aaron and Max
- targeted towards red teamers/pentesters

---

# Pitfalls

- Limited real-world utility
- bad reputation due to abuse by script kiddies
- mostly written in Ruby
- it can be quite slow

---

# How it can be useful

- As part of pentests that are fully automated
- when used with automation tools such as Pymetasploit3
- particularly useful for remote code execution attacks that are widely exploitable

---

# How it works

- A git repo full of Python/Ruby scripts that are organised into folders
- set a couple of options interactively and then run it

---

# Prerequisite: "The Terminal"

- NOT scary
- NOT complicated
- NOT all the same

---

| The Terminal      | T'Internet  |
|-------------------|-------------|
| terminal prompt   | website     |
| terminal emulator | web browser |

---

Like a website, you can navigate between terminal prompts

# Metasploit commands

There are many, but the commands that you will probably need today are:

```
$ msfconsole
$ msfvenom
```

---

# msfconsole

The main Metasploit console

---

# msfvenom

A tool for generating payloads.

---

# Meterpreter

A payload that is used to control a compromised system.

AKA a fancy bash shell

---

# Example usage

---

# Finding exploits

```
msf > search foo
```

---

# Running an exploit

```
msf > use exploit/linux/http/ivanti_connect_secure_rce_cve_2023_46805
msf exploit(ivanti_connect_secure_rce_cve_2023_46805) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(ivanti_connect_secure_rce_cve_2023_46805) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(ivanti_connect_secure_rce_cve_2023_46805) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(ivanti_connect_secure_rce_cve_2023_46805) > exploit
```

# Payloads

- Single - A payload that connects back to the attacker and executes in one step.
- Stage - A smaller payload that sets up a connection and downloads a larger payload (the stager).
- Stager - The initial part of a multi-stage payload that establishes a communication channel before the main payload is
  delivered.

---

# Summary

Metasploit is a useful tool for learning how to exploit vulnerable machines and for doing automated pen tests.
