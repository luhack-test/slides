# VLANs

- VLANs are network configs to break larger networks into virtually separate networks
- They are configured at the switch level

# VLAN ids and security

- VLANs are identified by a number
- VLANs are not secure by themselves (as they can be spoofed)
- But on trusted network segments they can be used to segregate traffic
- You should put untrusted devices on ports assigned to a VLAN (not using the VLAN tag)

# Subnets

Subnets are segments of larger networks

CIDR IP: 10.0.0.1/8

Subnet: 255.0.0.0

Includes all addresses from 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255

or

CIDR IP: 192.168.1.1/25

Subnet: 255.255.255.128
Binary subnet: 11111111 11111111 11111111 10000000

Includes all addresses from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.127

# Remember

All issues with networks can be traced back to layer 8

# Demo

I'm going to show you how to set up a switch and a firewall, these bits are going to be important.
