# What is ethical hacking?

Taking advantage of something’s existing functionality in an unintended way to achieve a goal\.

In ethical hacking, this goal is to  **improve the security of a system**. This is achieved through finding and  __responsibly disclosing__  vulnerabilities in a process called  __Penetration Testing__.

Most importantly\, this process is done  __legally__  and with  __explicit permission__  from the system owner.


---


#  ⚠ A Serious Warning ⚠

Over the course of the year you are going to learn a number of skills that can be used in a malicious manner.   

This is  __NOT__ what we are running the group for.

## We do not tolerate malicious or illegal behaviour.

We will not hesitate to report you to relevant authorities for misuse of the material we deliver


---


# In case that isn’t scary enough for you...


**Unauthorised access to computer material**, punishable by **twelve months**' imprisonment and/or an **unlimited fine**.

**Unauthorised access with intent to commit or facilitate commission of further offences**, punishable by **twelve months**/**maximum fine** on summary conviction and/or **five years**/fine on indictment;

**Unauthorised modification of computer material**, punishable by **twelve months**/**maximum fine** on summary conviction and/or **ten years**/fine on indictment;


<span class="small-text">You might also be hired by GCHQ</span>

# Avoid these laws with some simple steps

Don’t mess with systems that aren’t yours\, instead practice on either your own hardware\, our lab machines\, and websites such as Hack The Box\.

When doing pen\-tests\, **always** discuss with the client to decide on appropriate scope and get this **in writing**.
